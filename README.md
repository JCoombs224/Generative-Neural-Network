# Generative-Neural-Network

This repository showcases a generative neural network implemented from scratch in C++. The neural network is trained to predict the output of the function (cos(x) + 1) * 0.5, where x represents the input value.

The neural network model is built using C++ and incorporates fundamental concepts of artificial neural networks, most foundationally - back propagation. The code is designed to provide a clear understanding of the underlying principles of neural networks.
